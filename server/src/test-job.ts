Senior Full Stack Engineer, KeeperTax: San Francisco, CA Protecting tax filers from audits on automobile mileage Users who claim mileage as business expense tend to round their mileage (20,000 miles), or exaggerate (122,899 miles). IRS commonly targets those actions for audits. To discourage this, I added React components and additional steps in the tax filing flow to explain this and require people to add an explanation if they were claiming very high mileage. Customer Service UI updates: Created feature for customer service agents to be able to label customers with tags like ‚Äútried to cancel‚Äù or ‚Äúunhappy customer.‚Äù  Gathered requirements, created a new MySQL table, added NodeJS server endpoints, and React components. Allow use of ITIN (Individual Taxpayer Identification Number) IRS allows filing with ITIN instead of SSN, but KeeperTax needed to add support to allow customers without a SSN to file their taxes with us. I updated the MySQL database schema, changed React components and Contentful content to accurately route users through the UI if they were using ITIN. ITIN‚Äôs can expire so also had to add logic checking and explaining this possibility to users.  2022-2023 Open Source Contributions: See FreeCodeCamp, Federal Elections Commision and British Columbia Wildfire Predictive Services  Backend Software Engineer, HumanAPI: San Mateo (Remote), CA  Worked at Human API on a team which built and maintained AWS step functions and Lambdas that are used to order and download health data.
